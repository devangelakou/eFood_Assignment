# eFood_Assignment
This is part of an assignment to create a new marketing segment for 'coffee' as a subset of the 'breakfast' segment. 

The sql queries answer three initial questions: 
Q1: how many orders are placed in the "Breakfast" cuisine (Breakfast_Orders)?
Q2:	how many users ordered from the "Breakfast" cuisine (Breakfast_Users)?
Q3:	what is the Average Basket of the Breakfast_Users that we defined before?

To run these queries you'll need access to the Google Cloud Platform and to the test data: `bi-2019-test.ad_hoc.orders_jan2021` provided by eFood. 
Once you've set up your GCP account and have access to the data, copy past the queries to the editor and run them one by one. 

A further analysis of the dataset is done in the explorer tool of Data Studio: 
https://datastudio.google.com/u/1/navigation/explorer >> eFood_assignment_v2 and _v3

The final results are presented in the Data Studio report: https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/98f31f66-84c7-4c31-9a0d-b9a1080e8fe1 

As a back up I've uploaded a static (PDF) version of the report in this file.
